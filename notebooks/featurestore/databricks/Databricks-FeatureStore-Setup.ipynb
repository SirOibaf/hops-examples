This notebook assumes that you are running Hopsworks Enterprise Edition and you have already installed the Hops Python libarary. \nThe library is available here: https://github.com/logicalclocks/hops-util-py - make sure the version of the Hops Python library and the Hopsworks version match. You can follow the Databricks instructions on how to install Python libraries. https://docs.databricks.com/libraries.html\n\nThis notebook complements the Hopsworks Documentation you can find here: https://hopsworks.readthedocs.io/en/1.2/featurestore/featurestore.html#connecting-from-databricks-notebooks - In particular, before running the notebook you should make sure you have generated a new API Key (https://hopsworks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/hopsworks/apiKeys.html) and you have setup correctly the Parameter Store or the Secrets Manager.\nIf your Hopsworks instance is running on Azure or you don't have the privileges to modify the AWS Parameter Store or Secrets Manager, you can write the API key on a file on DBFS pass the path to the `setup_databricks` method using the `api_key_file` parameter.\n\nYou should also make sure that the Databricks cluster can communicate with the Hopsworks Feature Store. You can achieve that by either deploying Hopsworks in the same VPC as your Databricks cluster, or by configuring VPC peering (https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/aws/vpc-peering.html#vpc-peering)"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from hops import featurestore\n\n# Create a folder on DBFS to store the Hopsworks certificates.
